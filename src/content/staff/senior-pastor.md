# Arc. Armstrong Uzoagwa

I’m an architect, DevOps engineer, and Forex trader. I help creative professionals use code, capital, and concrete to build real wealth — without client dependency.

## My Mission

To empower architects, designers, and builders with systems that **automate their firms**, **fund their projects**, and **future-proof their designs**.

No more trading time for money.  
No more waiting for clients.  
Just **real systems that build real things**.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Smart Architecture**: Designing self-healing, IoT-enabled buildings
- **DevOps Automation**: Automating BIM, CI/CD, and deployment pipelines
- **Forex as Funding**: Using disciplined trading to finance builds
- **Builder Finance**: Creating side-income engines for creators
- **Tech-Integrated Design**: Merging code and construction

## Professional Journey

I’ve spent over a decade in architectural practice, but I’ve also built systems that run themselves.

- Automated design workflows using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**
- Funded real builds with **Forex profits** — not client invoices
- Designed **smart structures** with embedded sensors and automation
- Taught architects how to **escape the hourly grind**

This isn’t theory.  
It’s what I do — every day.

## Personal Life

Based in Nigeria, I’m passionate about **innovation in African architecture**, **financial independence for creatives**, and **building self-sustaining systems**.

When I’m not coding or trading, I’m sketching designs, mentoring young architects, or exploring how technology can solve real-world building challenges.

## Let’s Connect

Whether you’re an architect looking to automate your firm, a creator wanting to fund your vision, or a builder ready to go beyond clients — I’d love to hear from you.
