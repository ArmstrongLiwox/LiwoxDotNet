## Course Overview

Learn how to use disciplined Forex trading to fund your real-world architecture and design projects — without relying on traditional clients.

This course is for creative professionals who are tired of the hourly grind and want to **build what they want**, not just what clients will pay for.

You’ll discover how to treat Forex not as a get-rich-quick scheme, but as a **practical funding engine** — like a business account that pays for your builds.

### What You’ll Learn

- ✅ **Side Income for Builders**: Turn trading into a reliable funding stream
- ✅ **Risk-Managed Strategies**: Trade with rules, not emotions
- ✅ **Reinvest Profits**: Use Forex gains to finance builds, tools, and automation
- ✅ **Escape the Hourly Grind**: Build what you want, not just what clients will pay for

### Why This Works

Most architects and designers are stuck in the **client loop**:
> Pitch → Wait → Revise → Invoice → Repeat

This course shows how to break free by using Forex as a **funding tool** — not gambling, but **disciplined capital generation**.

Think of it like this:
> Instead of waiting for a client to fund your dream project…  
> You fund it yourself — with trading profits.

No more compromise. No more delays.

### How It Works

1. **Start Small**: Dedicate 1–2 hours per week to learning and trading
2. **Use a Demo Account**: Practice risk-free for 30 days
3. **Deploy Capital**: Start small with real money ($100–$500)
4. **Reinvest Profits**: Allocate 50–70% of gains to your next build
5. **Scale**: Grow your trading account as your confidence grows

> 💡 Example: Turn a $500/month Forex profit into a self-funded tiny home, studio, or smart renovation.

### Tools & Templates Included

- 📊 **Forex ROI Calculator** (Google Sheets)
- 📅 **30-Day Trading Practice Plan**
- 🛠️ **BIM Automation Checklist** (free download)
- 📚 **Recommended Reading List** (DevOps + Finance)

### Challenge for the Week

1. **Open a demo Forex account** (e.g., on TradingView or MetaTrader)
2. **Practice one trade** using a risk-managed strategy (max 1% risk)
3. **Write down one project** you’d fund if you had $1,000 in trading profits
